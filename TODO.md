# EDA TODO List

Below is AI generated, but we can adapt it to our dataset

- [ ] Create countplot to check class distribution
- [ ] Make bar plot to compare feature means by class  
- [ ] Generate scatter plot with classes colored to see separation
- [ ] Use pairplot to overview feature relationships  
- [ ] Draw boxplots to check distributions by class
- [ ] Plot histograms to see shape of feature distributions
- [ ] Calculate correlation matrix heatmap to identify correlations
- [ ] Produce clustermap to reveal internal data structures
